Files in this directory starting with a dot (.) are ignored as news items
So you can create a news-item with a dot first, and rename it when it needs
to go live.

The entire text in the file is placed as the news-item, any HTML and php is
allowed, as it is included verbatim.

The file-modification time is used to create the date on the news-item
If you need to alter the date, use touch -d YYYY-MM-dDD <file>

The file-name is used as the news-item title, it's placed in a <h3>
