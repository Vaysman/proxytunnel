<P CLASS=title>Proxytunnel News</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2004/11/2 - Proxytunnel 1.2.3 released</P>
<P>Version 1.2.3 includes a security-fix as reported by the Gentoo security team. If you use proxytunnel you are advised to upgrade if you don't trust your proxy-host.</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2004/10/12 - Proxytunnel 1.2.2 released</P>
<P>I really should update the news page when making new releases ;) We are already up to 1.2.2. This version has a security fix (Storing proxy username and password in env-vars) and some new makefiles (and the older ones cleaned up).</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2002/11/20 - Proxytunnel 1.1.2 released</P>
<P>After a long and quiet period i've spent some more time updating the webpages, sourceforge project pages and source-code. You'll find a new 1.1.2 version on the download and project page and also the cvs-tree has been updated and cleaned up. Debian packages are available from <A HREF="http://l.leguyader.free.fr/depot/proxytunnel/">free.fr</A> or can be created using the scripts in the package.</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2002/04/22 - Cygwin-version (windows) updated with stand-alone mode</P>
<P>After a long debugging session the stand-alone mode now also works on the cygwin platform (Any windows version after and including win95). The new proxytunnel.exe file is available on the download page. Sourcecode is available in CVS as usual.</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2002/04/21 - Various binaries available for testing</P>
<P>You can find various binaries available for testing on the download page.
These were made on the SourceForge compilefarm. They have not (all) been fully
tested, but are expected to work. We currently know of an issue with the windows
version. It doesn't yet work in standalone mode. We are looking in to this, but
if you can provide any assistance we would be very glad, since we are both no
win32/cygwin experts.</P>
<P CLASS=subtitle>2002/04/20 - New version nearing completion</P>
<P>We've been working hard on improving ProxyTunnel even more, we have
ported and tested proxytunnel on all systems available to us in the
SourceForge.net compile-farm (7 archs) and made the binaries available
for download on the download page. Source tarballs have been updated to
reflect these changes, as has the CVS tree.<BR>
This version (1.1 beta) includes support for running ProxyTunnel as a
stand-alone application. This means that it binds itself to a local tcp-port
awaiting connections. On receiving a connection, ProxyTunnel will establish
a tunnel through the HTTP(S) proxy and begin tunneling.<BR>
This feature will make ProxyTunnel even more useful, and we're sure you
can think up many new ways to use ProxyTunnel. Using this feature it's
also possible to make use of ProxyTunnel from programs like putty and other
SSH clients that do not yet support the ProxyCommand directive (like
openSSH does).

<P CLASS=subtitle>2002/04/03 - Interesting Article at NLUUG E-Zine</P>
<P>Muppet has written an interesting article about the usage of Proxytunnel.
It's been published on the <A
HREF=http://e-zine.nluug.nl/hold.html?cid=196">NLUUG E-Zine</A> webpages. And
we've also placed a <A HREF="papers/muppet-200204.html">copy here.</A></P>
