<h3>What came before...</h3>
Most of us have come across the following situation: you are working
at your employer or at a customer location, and the local penny
pinchers have decided that Internet access should be limited to sending
mail (but only if it comes from the standard Exchange or Notes servers)
and surfing the web. Other types of Internet access (telnet, FTP, SSH, 
POP, IMAP, SMTP) are usually completely out of the question for reasons 
which kind of elude me most of the time, even when there is a clear
business case for that access to be allowed. And even when we are 
restricted to web browsing, more often than not that facility is 
limited to the "bare bones". Downloading executables or binary archives 
(tar, zip, gzip et cetera) is usually not allowed (which makes
downloading software and patches for official company projects rather
difficult).

<p>
Fortunately, most proxy administrators can not write regular 
expressions very well. At one site I know (let's call them BigAcme 
corporation), the proxies check for URL that end in the well known 
extensions ".exe", ".gz" and ".zip". Nobody cared to inform the proxy 
admins that bzip2 exists, so downloading ".bz2" files is allowed... 
:-).  Furthermore, since URLs are allowed to contain a "query string" 
(for passing in form field values through an HTTP GET), adding a "?x" 
to a download URL fools the regular expression filters but does not 
destroy the validity of the URL. More often than not, the server on 
the other side processes the query string and then happily ignores it. 
I have downloaded many a vendor patch and open source product that way.

<p>
Another very fruitful activity in restricted environments like 
BigAcme's is looking for other Internet gateways. Large, multinational 
organisations consist of many business units, some of which might want 
to be in charge of their own Internet connection lest they be dependent 
on the experts that configure the central infrastructure and keep it 
going. It is not uncommon for these business units to have been 
independent companies (with all the infrastructural bells and whistles) 
that have been acquired by BigAcme. Keeping that infrastructure in 
place is just as easy as removing it, and having an extra 2 Mbps
Internet connection from your local office can just be the perk that 
keeps sysadmins happy. Since these stealth Internet connections are not 
managed by the central rulebook, they are often more relaxed; for 
instance allowing downloads of all sorts of files and not requiring 
proxy authentication.

<p>
Another road to download freedom is having a completely illegal 
Internet connection terminating at one of the BigAcme offices. I have 
been in situations where a particular project took out an Internet 
access subscription with a local cable Internet provider. So, in our 
plush BigAcme HQ offices, a cable modem stood blinking happily (and 
rapidly), providing unlimited Internet access to those who were friends 
with (and bought beers for) the project administrators.

<p>
More recently, I have been thinking about bringing in an illegal ADSL 
connection in the office (by subscribing to an ADSL access 
provider or another), and then terminating that connection with a 
NetGear MR314 device, which provides ADSL capability combined with a 
10/100 Mbps switch <u>and</u> an wireless (IEEE 802.11b) base station. 
Or perhaps take out a <a href="http://www.sputnik.com">Sputnik</a>

subscription (who throw in a similar box with the subscription).
Then, everyone with a wireless PCMCIA card in his laptop can access the 
Internet unrestricted. Sharing the cost between ten people or so 
might make it an interesting alternative....

<h3>But something kept bothering me...</h3>
When I first plunged into the internals of HTTPS proxies, the idea on 
how to abuse these for unlimited Internet access immediately came to 
me. It dawned on me that, in essence, an HTTPS web proxy is a sort of 
tunnel into the Internet for everyone who is willing to speak the HTTP's
protocol CONNECT command. And since all the traffic that passed through the 
tunnel is supposed to be SSL encrypted (so as to form an unhindered SSL 
session between the browser and the HTTPS server), there are little or 
no access controls possible on such a tunnel. I filed these ideas under 
the section "Interesting; must do something with this later"...

<p>
When "later" came, it turned out that the realisation described above
could have very interesting security repercussions.....

<h3>A bit more on HTTPS proxies</h3>
The SSL protocol was invented by Netscape to provide encrypted TCP/IP 
sessions between clients and servers. HTTP + SSL (nicknamed HTTPS) can 
be used to secure communication between web browsers and web servers, 
often for the purpose of keeping the information that is passed hence 
and forth confidential (e.g. credit card numbers or porn pictures of US 
catholic church officials engaged in their favorite pastime). SSL 
provides authentication of the (web) server, encryption of the data 
passed through network connection and optionally authentication of 
the (browser) client (through client certificates, a feature of SSLv3). 
>From a security perspective, there are all sorts of things one can say 
about SSL, but let me suffice by saying that it works relatively well 
and is in widespread use.

<p>
HTTPS provides an interesting problem for the web proxies that allow
World Wide Web access through the corporate firewall. In general, web
proxies are supposed to receive an HTTP request from a browser, then
execute it on behalf of the browser and return the result:

<pre>

                                                        |
    +-----------+                   +---------+         |
    |           |  HTTP request     |         |  HTTP request
    |  Browser  +-------------------&gt; Proxy  +------------&gt;
    |           |                   |         |         |
    +-----------+                   +---------+         |
                                                   Corporate
						   firewall


</pre>

<p>
As shown in the "picture", the proxy receives the request from the 
browser, and forwards it onto the web server (also called the "origin 
server") or a downstream proxy. The corporate firewall has to allow
Internet access by the proxy in order to let the proxy execute WWW
requests on behalf of the users on the inside of the network. Because 
it is in the middle of each connection, the proxy is extremely well 
placed to perform all sorts of checks on the request and the answer. 
Common proxy features in this area are:

<ol>
<li>Requiring the browser/user to authenticate before accepting the
request (adds proxy authentication headers to the request that are
checked by the proxy and removed before passing on the request).
</li>
<li>Checking the site and resource contained in the request URL
and (dis)allowing certain sites or resource names.
</li>
<li>Checking the answer for viruses.
</li>
<li>(Dis)allowing certain types of answers (e.g. blocking executables,
ActiveX, MP3 et cetera).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Another common proxy feature is caching answers so that subsequent 
requests for the same site/resource return the result from the cache 
instead of having to go out to the Internet each time.

<p>
You can hopefully see why HTTPS forms a problem for proxies (if you 
can not, please stop reading the article right here :-): The whole point 
of using SSL is that nobody in between the browser and the web server 
can read or modify the request, not even the proxy or the corporate 
firewall! This means that an HTTPS proxy must support some sort of 
tunnel that allows all bits to flow freely between the browser and the 
origin server. Consequently (since it can not make heads or tails of 
anything that flows by), caching and any sort of request or content 
scanning is impossible:

<pre>


    +-----------+                   +---------+
    |           |                   |         |
    |  Browser  |                   |  proxy  |
    |           |  HTTP over SSL    +---------+  HTTP over SSL
    |           +-------------------&gt;-tunnel--&gt;----------------&gt;
    |           |                   +---------+
    +-----------+                   |         |
                                    +---------+


</pre>

<p>

So, if companies want to allow internal users to use SSL when surfing 
the net (for instance to do online shopping or viewing privacy 
sensitive information), they have no other choice but to install an 
HTTPS proxy, which basically is a generic tunnel for these requests.

<p>
However, all is not lost for them (or at least, that's what they 
thought :-).

<p>
First of all, for reasons of network architecture and access control, 
the HTTPS connection is an application level tunnel. This means that 
there are actually two TCP/IP connections involved: one between the 
browser and the proxy, and one between the proxy and the origin server. 
The proxy software acts as the bridge between these two connections, 
faithfully shuttling all data between the two connections. An 
interesting question now arises: "How does the proxy know which origin 
server to contact?"

<p>
This problem occurs because the actual HTTP request that contains this 
information is encrypted by the SSL layers, and thus withheld from the 
proxy software. If the browser connects to the proxy and immediately 
starts sending the encrypted data (actually: Tries to engage in an SSL 
handshake), the proxy software would have no clue as to which origin 
server to connect to!

<p>
This problem is solved by inserting a small HTTP-like protocol in front 
of the actual SSL handshake and HTTP request. The browser, when 
connecting to the proxy in order to create an HTTPS tunnel, first sends 
a CONNECT instruction that informs the proxy to what origin server and 
port it should connect. If the proxy accepts this destination, it 
returns an OK reply and opens the tunnel. The browser can then start 
sending whatever it wants, which the proxy shuttles to the origin 
server, and back.

<p>
One can execute the CONNECT command manually if one wants to using the 
telnet program (like the rest of the HTTP protocol):

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ telnet some-proxy 8080
Trying 136.232.33.11...
Connected to some-proxy.
Escape character is '^]'.
CONNECT www.verisign.com:443 HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
Proxy-agent: Netscape-Proxy/3.52

// ---&gt; Tunnel and SSL session starts here
^]
telnet&gt; close
Connection closed.

</pre>

<p>
In this example, the first two lines have been sent by me. The CONNECT 
statement instructs the proxy to connect to port 443 (the HTTPS port) 
of the server <i>www.verisign.com</i>. The proxy answers with an OK 
reply with some extra information thrown in. The reply ends with a 
blank line, after which the tunnel is open and I could start sending 
interesting information (like an SSL <i>client_hello</i> message).

<p>
Because of the semantics of the CONNECT command, the proxy can enforce 
some limited security on the connection:

<ol>
<li>It can refuse to connect to particular servers and/or ports.
</li>
<li>It can request proxy authentication.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If authentication is necessary, the proxy returns a "Please 
authenticate" reply, upon which the browser can request the user for a 
userid and a password, and then redo from start. Most proxies restrict 
access only with respect to the TCP ports that can be connected to. 
Usually only port 443 (HTTPS) and 563 (NNTP (the Usenet news transport 
protocol over TCP/IP) over SSL) are allowed.

<h3>Abusing HTTPS proxies, small fry</h3>
Some time ago it dawned on me that you could abuse the HTTPS proxy to 
connect to any network service, as long as you first execute the 
CONNECT command to establish the proxy tunnel. I tested this with trying 
to telnet through an HTTPS proxy to my FreeBSD box at home (which is 
cable modem connected).  Unfortunately, I immediately ran into two 
problems:

<ol>
<li>The BigAcme proxy that I was using for these tests did not allow 
tunneling to port 23 of an origin server.
</li>
<li>The proxy also required me to authenticate myself using a proxy 
userid and password.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first problem was solved quite easily by modifying my <i>inetd </i>

configuration to also listen on port 443 and spawning a <i>telnetd</i> for 
incoming connections. After opening up port 443 in my firewall rules, I 
could telnet in on port 443 and login to the MuppetZone server.

<p>
The second problem was also not extremely difficult to solve. HTTP proxy 
authentication uses a pretty mindless scheme wherein a userid and 
password are base64 encoded and added to the request through a 
<i>Proxy-authorization</i> header. The relevant RFC's (e.g. 2068) 
contain all the necessary details. If you know a proxy userid and 
password, constructing the header to add to the request is very simple. 
I wrote a small C program to build the base64 encoded string, copied it 
into my telnet program and off I went:

<pre>
muppet@runabout:~ &gt; telnet some-proxy 8080
Trying 136.232.33.11...
Connected to some-proxy.
Escape character is '^]'.
CONNECT www.muppetzone.com:443 HTTP/1.0

<p>
Hurrah! I was in!


<p>
Obviously, stopping here was not an issue! I was just getting 
fired up!  

<p>
My actual goal was to modify OpenSSH so that it could 
connect to an SSH daemon through an HTTPS proxy. I foresaw that making 
such a modification should not be too difficult: some minor surgery on 
the OpenSSH code to execute the CONNECT command between creating the 
network socket and before starting the SSH handshake would do the trick 
(or so I reckoned).  And so, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I started 
digging through the OpenSSH source code to locate the point where my 
code scalpel should go in....

<p>
However, to my great surprise, OpenSSH contained a great feature that I 
did not know about then: the ability to specify an external command 
that it should use to create the network connection to the SSH daemon
running on the server. I immediately decided that this feature 
(ProxyCommand) would allow me to create a separate program that 
executed the CONNECT command and that I could plug into SSH! And, some 
hours later, the first version of ProxyTunnel was ready for its first 
test drive!

<h3>ProxyTunnel</h3>
ProxyTunnel is a small C program that is parameterised with the proxy 
to connect through, a proxy userid/password and the name and port of a 
server to connect to. ProxyTunnel builds a network connection 
to the proxy and executes the CONNECT command (authenticating to the 
proxy as specified). Once it has done so it then acts as a bridge 
between its caller and the proxy/target server (it does this through 
inherited file descriptors 0 and 1). <i>[Please note that any examples 
I give here use the parameter format of the current release of 
ProxyTunnel. The first releases used a somewhat different command line 
format, but that is not important right now.]</i> <p>
Connecting to an SSH server in the Internet through ProxyTunnel and an 
SSH proxy requires you to create an SSH host description for a virtual 
destination. Most commonly (on Unix), this entry has to be created in 
<i>$HOME/.ssh/config</i>, for instance:

<pre>
Host casa
	ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/proxytunnel -g some-proxy -G 8080 -d www.muppetzone.com -D 443

</pre>

<p>
This definition defines a virtual SSH host called <i>casa</i>, which
can be reached through ProxyTunnel by connecting to the HTTPS proxy
<i>some-proxy</i> on port 8080, and requesting it to connect to the SSH
daemon running on server <i>www.muppetzone.com</i> on port 443.

<p>
When you have this setting in place, you can connect using SSH to host 
"casa". SSH "knows" that it has to use ProxyTunnel to make the 
connection, so it starts it up.  ProxyTunnel uses the tricks explained 
in the previous chapters to create a tunnel to the SSH daemon on the 
target server. It works like a charm! Really!

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ ssh casa
Connected to some-proxy:8080
Starting tunnel
FreeBSD 4.6-RELEASE (MUPPETZONE) #4: Fri May  5 10:27:29 CEST 2000

This is the Muppet zone. You are not welcome. Go Away!

$ exit
Connection to casa closed.

</pre>

<p>
The only "problem" you might run into is that most HTTPS proxies do not 
allow browsers to connect to HTTPS servers on ports other than 443 and 
563. This also means that ProxyTunnel can not request these proxies to 
connect to an SSH daemon on the default port of SSH (which is 22). The 
easiest solution to this problem is to also run an SSH daemon on port 
443 (or 563). This kinda limits the systems you can SSH to, but usually 
we have enough control over one or two systems in the net to run an SSH 
daemon on these ports, which we can then use as jump boxes onto other 
systems.

<p>
After developing the initial release of ProxyTunnel, my friend Maniac 
stepped in to help test and improve the code. He cleaned up some of the 
source, added better command line option handling, put ProxyTunnel up 
on SourceForge and solved a few bugs.

<h4>Small open issue</h4>
Before I continue to blow ProxyTunnel's trumpet of honour even more I 
would like to draw your attention to one small open item in 
ProxyTunnel's implementation: A lot of HTTPS proxies have a habit of 
closing the tunnel if they have not seen any traffic for a certain 
(usually configurable) amount of time. That means that when you use 
ProxyTunnel to SSH into a site, and there is no stdio interaction for 
that time limit, the connection is closed.

<p>
In a sense, this is not ProxyTunnel's fault, because it is the HTTPS 
proxy that does the evil deed. However, I can also imagine why the 
proxy software developers implemented this feature, so no hard feelings
there :-). It is nonetheless quite irritating... I did find two 
solutions to this small annoyance. The first one is a real low tech 
solution: whenever I switch away from an SSH/ProxyTunnel session I have 
made it a habit to start the <i>top</i> command.  Top shows a screen 
with Unix/Linux performance indicators which it regularly updates (the 
indicators that is, and therewith the screen).  Because top refreshes
the screen regularly (generating network traffic to the SSH client), 
the proxy does not enter the contemplative state of "mind" in which it 
starts to ponder on whether to close the session or not.

<p>
A somewhat more high tech solution (and one that I like a lot) requires
changes to the SSH implementation. I found out at that the Debian GNU/Linux 
people extended the SSH client with a ProxyKeepAlive feature that comes
in quite handy. When ProxyKeepAlive is enabled (through the SSH config 
file), the client regularly sends empty SSH control messages to the SSH 
daemon. This also has the effect of keeping the connection active (and 
thereby, alive).

<h3>On to scp!</h3>

The fun thing with getting SSH to work through HTTPS proxies is that 
there are so much more fun things one could do. For instance, SSH also 
has a secure copy command (scp) that is able to transfer files and 
directories across an encrypted SSH connection. Because scp uses SSH, 
the ProxyTunnel also shuttles scp through the HTTPS tunnel: both in 
"put" and in "get" mode! So, our download problems have disappeared 
like snow on a sunny day in the Carribean!

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet/articles $ scp proxytunnel.html casa:
Connected to some-proxy:8080
Starting tunnel
proxytunnel.html     100% |*****************************| 40371      00:02    
</pre>

<p>
Oh, and by the way, the reason that the SSH daemon on <i>casa</i> does
not request any passwords is because I have set up SSH to perform
user authentication based on a private/public keypair handshake and
the <i>ssh-agent</i> (a standard part of the OpenSSH software).

<h3>Popping your mail with ProxyTunnel</h3>
But, there is even more that SSH and ProxyTunnel can do for you! What
about using SSH/ProxyTunnel to POP (or IMAP) your mail in? It can
be done!

<p>

One of the many features of SSH is to use the encrypted network 
connection that the client has with the SSH daemon to provide TCP port 
forwarding. With port forwarding enabled, the SSH client can listen to
a port on the local system, and forward any traffic it receives there
to a port on another system at the remote site of the SSH connection:

<pre>

Some program                              Whoever is listening
	     |                                            ^
             |                                            |

	 | port  |                                    +--------+
          \-----/                                         ^ 
             |                                            |
             V                                            |
       +-----+------+                               +-----+------+

</pre>

<p>
With ProxyTunnel, the SSH connection between the SSH client and the SSH
daemon is replaced by a ProxyTunnel/HTTPS proxy construct:

<p>
It looks rather complex (and if you contemplate everything that needs
to be lined up correctly to make it work, it actually is), but it
nevertheless works like a charm! (Hail to the power of abstractions and
layering!)

<p>
With a setup like this, it is not difficult to create an environment
with which we can download our mail from a remote server. All we need is:

<ol>
<li>A POP client like <i>fetchmail</i>.
</li>
<li>An industry standard POP server
</li>
<li>Some nifty configurations (but that should not be problematic, since
we have not been doing anything else from the start of this article :-)
</ol>

<p>

You first need to set up an SSH tunnel that connects some local port to
the POP port of the remote POP server (usually 110). The SSH tunnel has
to use a special (ProxyTunnel) enabled virtual SSH host (like <i>casa</i>
in the previous example). Setting up the tunnel then goes something like:

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ ssh -L 2110:mail.muppetzone.com:110 casa
</pre>

<p>
This SSH invocation sets up an SSH connection to <i>casa</i> (which 
uses the ProxyTunnel per the SSH local config file), connecting local 
port 2110 through the SSH connection to port 110 on host 
<i>mail.muppetzone.com</i>.  From that moment on, whenever I connect to 
port 2110 on the local host, the SSH tunnel will forward my connection 
to the POP port of the mail server: 

<pre>

muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ telnet localhost 2110
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK POP3 mail.muppetzone.com v2000.70rh server ready
quit
+OK Sayonara
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

<p>
My next step is to configure my POP client to load all mail from the 
local host through port 2110. How this is exactly achieved depends on 
your POP client, but with Fetchmail I would configure my local 
<i>.fetchmailrc</i> file something like this:

<pre>
poll muppetmail with proto POP3 port 2110
       user "muppet" there is muppet here options fetchall mda "procmail -d muppet"
</pre>

<p>
And then finally, to get it to work, make the virtual host 
<i>muppetmail</i> an alias for the local host in the <i>/etc/hosts</i> 

file:

<pre>
127.0.0.1	localhost localhost.localnet muppetmail
</pre>

<p>
Set up like this, Fetchmail can then be used to retrieve your mail 
straight through the corporate firewall:

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ fetchmail muppetmail
Enter password for muppet@muppetmail: 
21 messages for muppet at localhost (297524 octets).
reading message muppet@localhost:1 of 21 (5773 octets) ..... flushed
reading message muppet@localhost:2 of 21 (2436 octets) .. flushed
reading message muppet@localhost:3 of 21 (13264 octets) ............  flushed
...
reading message muppet@localhost:21 of 21 (3106 octets) ... flushed
You have new mail in /var/spool/mail/muppet

</pre>

<h3>And now it gets really dangerous!</h3>
But, the fun does not stop there! SSH can also be used to setup 
<b>reverse tunnels</b>! Yes sirreh! Using a reverse tunnel, a TCP port 
on the remote SSH daemon's system can be connected (forwarded) to a 
host and port on the local site. Once set up this means that everybody 
that has access to the remote system can establish connections to the 
system at the local end of the tunnel. It acutally allows someone 
to set up an environment in which it is possible to connect (e.g. 
telnet, FTP or SSH) into a protected corporate network from the 
Internet, straight through the corporate firewall!

<p>

Let this fact sink in..... I'll repeat it for clarity:

<p>
<b>IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS SOMEONE TO SET UP AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT IS 
POSSIBLE TO CONNECT (E.G. TELNET, FTP OR SSH) INTO A PROTECTED 
CORPORATE NETWORK FROM THE INTERNET, STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CORPORATE 
FIREWALL</b>!

<p>
Let me explain how it works:

<h3>Setting up a reverse tunnel</h3>
>From the internal system, use SSH+ProxyTunnel to set up a reverse 
tunnel that connects some remote port on the remote system to port 23 
(telnet) of a local system:

<pre>
muppet@runabout:/home/muppet $ ssh -R 2323:some-sys.bigacme.com:23 casa
</pre>

<p>
>From this moment one, everybody who can log on the remote system 
<i>casa</i> (actually a system called <i>swamp</i>, a.k.a. 

<i>www.muppetzone.com</i>) can telnet to port 2323 on that local system 
and be patched through to port 23 (the telnet server port) of 
<i>some-sys.bigacme.com</i>, a system <u>inside</u> the BigAcme 
corporate firewall! Mind you, we have now created a setup through which 
we can telnet straight through the corporate firewall into a local 
BigAcme system!

<pre>
muppet@swamp:/home/muppet $ telnet localhost 2323
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.

<h3>Improving this system</h3>
With only a limited amount of effort it is possible to convert the 
remote tunnel example into a fully functional system for connecting to 
a system on the inside of the network using ssh. In order to implement 
this solution, you need:

<ol>
<li>User access (root access not necessary!) to a system on the inside 
of the network that can act as a gateway into the network. 
</li>
<li>A computer system in the Internet that runs the SSH daemon on a port
that is allowed by the corporate firewall that we want to penetrate (e.g.
port 443). A cable modem or ADSL connected Linux system will do just fine.

</li>
<li>ProxyTunnel :-)
</li>
<li>Some smart shell scripts
</li>
</ol>

<p>
On the internal system, you install SSH, ProxyTunnel and a small shell 
script (<i>tunnel</i>) that is run regularly (say every 5 minutes) 
through the Unix cron scheduler. This script uses scp to retrieve a 
small instruction file from the external system in the Internet (in 
this example, this file is called <i>tr</i> (for 
<u>t</u>unnel<u>r</u>equest). The <i>tr</i> file contains a flag that 
indicates whether a tunnel into the protected network is requested or 
not. 


<p>
After retrieving the tunnel request file the script does the following:

<ul>
<li>If a tunnel is requested, and there is currently a reverse tunnel
in operation, the script does nothing.
</li>
<li>If a tunnel is requested, and there is currently no tunnel operating,
the script uses an SSH command (like the one in the previous example) to
set up a reverse tunnel. Access into the protected network is now possible!
</li>
<li>If no tunnel is requested, but there is one running, the running tunnel
is terminated.
</li>
<li>If no tunnel is requested, and none is running, the script does nothing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For good measure, the script's action is summarised in a one-line status
message that is put back (again using <i>scp</i>) to the external system
in the Internet.


<p>
Meanwhile, on the external system we install a small script
(<i>maketun</i>) that opens up a tunnel into the protected network 
through the following procedure:

<ol>
<li>First it checks whether a tunnel already exists. If that is the case,
it connects to the existing tunnel.
</li>
<li>If no tunnel exists, it writes out a <i>tr</i> file that requests a
tunnel and starts waiting...
</li>
<li>While this script waits, the (time scheduled) tunnel script on the 
internal system retrieves the <i>tr</i> file and creates the tunnel.
</li>

<li>The script on the local system regularly checks whether the tunnel
has been created already. When it is, it emits three beeps and connects
to the tunnel. The user now has access to the internal system!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To prevent <i>scp</i> from requesting a password for retrieving the 
<i>tr</i> file and putting the <i>tr.status</i> file you generate a 
keypair for the user executing the script on the internal system (using 
the <i>ssh-keygen</i> program) and add the public key of the thusly 
generated keypair to the <i>authorized_keys</i> file of the user that 
manages the affairs on the external system (in the Internet). One could 
also use this trick the other way round: create a tunnel into the 
protected network that connects to the SSH daemon (port 22) on the 
internal system, and use keys to forego the password question when 
connecting to the protected internal system!!


<p>
For the unbelievers, here is a real life example of this system in
operation:

<pre>
muppet@swamp:/home/muppet $ maketun
Issuing tunnel request
Waiting for tunnel to open...
Waiting for tunnel to open...
Waiting for tunnel to open...
Waiting for tunnel to open...

<h4>And now, the code!</h4>

<h5>The <i>tr</i> file</h5>
The <u>t</u>unnel<u>r</u>equest file (<i>tr</i>) contains the request 
for the creation of a tunnel into the protected network:


<pre>
TUNNEL=0
</pre>

<h5>The <i>tr.status</i> file</h5>
The <i>tr.status</i> file contains the status of the last run of the 
managing script on the internal system. It is propagated back to the
internal system on each run:

<h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
Quite frankly, the possibilities are endless! I already adapted the 
<b>VTun</b> VPN software to use ProxyTunnel to make the 
connection between the VPN client and the VPN server. Using VTun, it is 
no longer necessary to use the cumbersome scripts explained in the 
previous chapter, but we can build a fully functional bidirectional 
Virtual Private Network that allows all possible UDP and TCP network 
facilities between the internal and external network straight through 
the HTTPS proxy. We can even make this very robust by improving VTun's 
automatic connection re-establishment and extending ProxyTunnel to be 
able to handle multiple HTTPS proxies (using them as a proxy rotary, 
connecting to different proxies until one works).

<p>
Also, the O'Reilly book on Virtual Private Networks contains an 
excellent chapter on setting up VPN's using PPP tunneled over SSH. With 
ProxyTunnel in the picture, we can tunnel the PPP/SSH connection 
through the HTTPS proxy, building an effective and simple VPN that 
allows full bidirectional connections out of and into the protected 
corporate network.


<h3>Some final remarks</h3>
<ul>
<li>ProxyTunnel was not created to allow this sort of breaking in and
entering of protected networks. It is a side effect... Please also
read the disclaimer at the start of this article.
</li>
<li>The situation is only moderately grave in the sense that in order 
to break into protected networks one must have had previous access to 
internal systems. However, the <i>tunnel</i> script that is installed
on the internal system can do its job unattended in the background. In
that sense, it is some sort of trojan horse...
</li>
<li>Setting up access from the outside to the inside using 
SSH/ProxyTunnel is much like installing a dial-in modem connected to an 
internal system. There are some qualitative differences though: this 
solution is much more silent and can be used by multiple people at the 
same time.
</li>
<li>ProxyTunnel is not exactly rocket science; I frankly can not 
imagine that I am the first to come up with these ideas or to write 
this code. However, I was not able to find references to similar 
features...
</li>
<li>As the great Dutch philosopher Johan Cruyff remarked: "Every 
advantage also has a disadvantage". In this case, the security 
disadvantages are quite clear, but hopefully the advantages are 
(somewhat) clear too. I initially designed and wrote ProxyTunnel to 
help me get Internet access for legitimite pruposes such as downloading 
vendor patches and reading my mail.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh yes, and finally: the original ProxyTunnel ran under Unix (also 
Linux/FreeBSD) only, but Maniac ported it to Windows NT (using 
Cygwin32), so NT only networks are also vulnerable....
</p>
