<P>After a long and quiet period i've spent some more time updating
the webpages, sourceforge project pages and source-code. You'll find
a new 1.1.2 version on the download and project page and also the
cvs-tree has been updated and cleaned up. Debian packages are
available from <A HREF="http://l.leguyader.free.fr/depot/proxytunnel/">free.fr</A> or can be created using the scripts in the package.</P>
