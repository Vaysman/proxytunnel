<P CLASS=title>ProxyTunnel Introduction</P>
<P>ProxyTunnel is a program that connects stdin and stdout to a server somewhere on the network, through a standard HTTPS proxy. We mostly use it to tunnel SSH sessions through HTTP(S) proxies, allowing us to do many things that wouldn't be possible without ProxyTunnel.</P>

<P>Here's an extract from the included README file:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is proxytunnel, a program that connects stdin and stdout
to an origin server somewhere in the Internet through an industry
standard HTTPS proxy. I originally wrote this program to be used
as an extension to SSH, to be able to SSH to my box at home. In
this file, I will describe the use with SSH. If you want to use it
with some other application, feel free, and let me know!
